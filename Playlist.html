			 <br><h3>goa trance</h3>
			 <p>The music has its roots in the popularity of Goa in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a hippie capital, and although musical developments were incorporating elements of industrial music, New 				beat and electronic body music (EBM), with the spiritual culture in India throughout the 1980s, the actual Goa trance style did not appear until the early 1990s</p>
			 <h3>Avate-garde</h3>
			 <p>Avant-garde music may be distinguished from experimental music by the way it adopts an extreme position within a certain tradition, whereas experimental music lies outside tradition.[2] In a 				historical sense, some musicologists use the term "avant-garde music" for the radical compositions that succeeded the death of Anton Webern in 1945,[3][verification needed] but others disagree. For 			   example, Ryan Minor writes that this period began with the work of Richard Wagner,[4] whereas Edward Lowinsky cites Josquin des Prez.[5] The term may also be used to refer to any post-1945 				tendency of modernist music not definable as experimental music, though sometimes including a type of experimental music characterized by the rejection of tonality.[3] A commonly cited example of 			avant-garde music is John Cage's 4'33" (1952),[1] a piece which instructs the performer(s) not to play their instrument(s) during its entire duration.[6] The piece has been described as “not a 				musical ‘work’ in the normal sense, only an occasion for a Zen-like meditation.”[7]</p>
